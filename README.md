# sierpinski_triangle_pygame
python (pygame) Sierpinski Triangle fractal
To use this, simply download the code to whatever editor you like (I was using VS Code), and run it. There are 3 different options, the base Sierpinski triangle, my created "Sierpinski square", and the "pentagon". To switch between, simply comment one out and uncomment the other on line 140. 
If you cannot run the file, you may need to install pygame. If using VS Code, go to "terminal" at the bottom, type "pip install pygame" and press enter. This should allow the code to run. If on another editor/IDE, you will need to install pygame in your respective way.
